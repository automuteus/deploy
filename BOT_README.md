# Create an Application and Bot account

1. Navigate to <https://discord.com/developers/applications> and create New Application (top right). Name it whatever you like.

2. Click "Bot" on the left panel, then click the button on the right to Add Bot.

3. Scroll up to where the Bot Icon is displayed. **Copy the `Token` on the right, and paste it to a safe location.** We will need it later in the installation steps; this is the `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` in the `.env` file (or the `config.txt` for the older version).

4. On the left panel, click `URL Generator` under `OAuth2`, and then check the boxes marked `bot` (required) and `applications.commands` (for the first bot only) under `SCOPES`. Then scroll down to `BOT PERMISSIONS`, and check the boxes as shown in the table below.

5. Scroll down to `GENERATED URL`, and copy the URL in the field that begins with `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?`. Paste this in a new browser tab, and grant the App access to whatever server you wish it to access. Close this tab when Finalized.
